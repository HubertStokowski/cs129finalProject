# cs129finalProject
Final project for the CS129 class
<br />
Main fitting code is located here:<br />
./mainFittingCode/FitAllPowers.m<br />
Running it will load 38 different optical transimission and SHG data and apply the nonlinear regression model to the data to learn parameters. Output data plots during my run were automatically saved in the following folder:<br />
./mainFittingCode/FitLineshapes20210313T191602<br />
The code creates a separate folder for each run (dated). Data can be exported here:<br />
./mainFittingCode/FitLineshapes20210313T191602/AllData2<br />
<br /><br />

For further data processing and error evaluation I use the following folder:<br />
./nonlinearRegressionTests<br />
I use the output of the previous section, local copy located here:<br />
./nonlinearRegressionTests/Data<br />
Script for final figure generation:<br />
./nonlinearRegressionTests/getProjectData.m<br />
Normalized RMSE calculation:<br />
./nonlinearRegressionTests/calculateNRMSEscirpt.m<br />
Results is exported to:<br />
./nonlinearRegressionTests/final_plots<br />
